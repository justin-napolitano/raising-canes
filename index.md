## Why am I writing this

Tonight, I mistreated my body.  I had raising Canes. I feel disgusting.  

### Food review

I tried the combo box - a massive amount of french fries served with coleslaw, some bread, and some chicken tenders. 

#### The Fries

They were fries - the crinkle cut variety- fried upin old grease.  They tasted like typical fries, but the grease wasa so old that the fries tasted like the grease underneath the lunch room tables you'd find a public high school.  I ate them.  i was hungry. But i regret it.

#### The Bread

The bread wasn't bad. I do not know what they put on it, but it wasn't bad.

#### The Slaw

I skipped it. I had already eaten too much food and felt disgusted with myself for it. 

#### The Tenders

The tenders were very plain and very dry. I am trying to be fair, but I could have gotten much better tenders from Costco for a fraction of the cost in the frozen food section.


### How I feel

I feel disgusted with myself... but atop of that I feel scammed. The food i ate was overpriced, disguting, and unhealthy.  I feel as if the company is exploiting and poisoning people.  I feel exploited. I did not need to go this place to eat.  I failed to plan and ended up there.  Many people just eat this type of food. God help them.

## Next time

I always say, "Next time I will plan better.." We shall see if that actually happens.  I need to stock up on nuts and easy to store grains.  I cannot eat this type of garbage.  Recently I have been eating McDonalds and fast food, because I am not in my own home.  I will brake this pattern before it becomes a habit.  These establishments horrifically exploit people.  I no longer want to be subject to the scam.
